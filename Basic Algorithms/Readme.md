# Data Structure Nanodegree Project 

### Project 1 Square root
Implemented binary search which results in O(logn) complexity where n is the number of elements to be checked for result

The space complexity
O(1) as no extra space in memory was used other that recurssion call stack
The Time complexity is O(logn).

### Project 2 Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

Binary search was used to make use of divide and conquer approach as the pivot can be somewher in the middle which helps to search quickly

The time complexity is O(logn) where n is the number of elements in the list

The space complexity is O(1)


### Project 3 Rearrange Array Elements

Mearge sor was implemented to sort the array and then two numbers were formed making their sum maximum

The time complexity is O(nlogn) where n is the number of elements in the array

The space complexity is O(n) Where n is the number of elements

### Project 4 Dutch National Flag Problem

The algorithm exploited the fact that there are only 3 elemets and thus the sorting occured in one traversal

Thus the time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list

The space complexity is O(1)

### Project 5 Autocomplete with Tries

Trie data structure was used according to the instructions given.


The time complexity will be O(L*d) where L is the lenght of word and d is number of different words

Space complexity is O(n) where n is the total elements.

### Project 6 Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
The max and min were taken out of the array in a single traversal and thus the time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list and the space complexity is O(1)

### Project 7 HTTPRouter using a Trie

SImilar to Problem 5 Trie data structure was used with some changes based on the application.

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the path and space complexity is also O(n)
